# Real-time-twitter-data-analysis-using-NLP
In this project, we will go through making a program that analyzes the nature of tweets on a
particular topic. The user will be able to input a keyword(hashtag) and get the nature on it based
on the latest tweets that contain the input keyword. Each tweet extracted classified based on its
sentiment whether it is positive or negative. Data were collected on movie reviews which were
on IMDB Website. Na√Øve Bayes machine learning algorithm was used. The result of this model
was tested using various testing metrics. Moreover, our model demonstrates a strong performance
on mining texts extracted directly from Twitter.
